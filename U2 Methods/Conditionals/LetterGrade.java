/**In this example, a method has been written to determine a studentâ€™s letter grade based on their percent.

  * 1. Play with the code to identify a few percent grades that are giving an incorrect numeric grade.
  * 2. Fix the code:  To do this, you should NOT rewrite any code.  
  *     Instead, copy and paste to move the conditional statements in to the correct order such that they work correctly.
