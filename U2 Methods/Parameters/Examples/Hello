/** This function is an example of how parameters can be used to reduce complexity of code by creating
  * functions with multiple uses. 
  * 
  * 
  * You should take some time to play with the code.  Try changing the following items, and then 
  * compiling and running your program after each one:
  * 1. Change the names printed in lines 26 and 27.
  * 2. Add another print statement within the run method to print another name.
  * 3. What happens if you add the following code to line 22: System.out.println(name); **Why?**
  * 4. What happens if you add the following method call within the run statement: printHello(7); **Why?**
