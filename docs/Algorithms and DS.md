## What is an algorithm? (ice cream truck)
![Whiteboard image](https://image.ibb.co/bSVxPc/Full_Whiteboard.jpg)
**Algorithm (n.):** A set of guildelines that describe how to perform a task.

Algorithms must always be:
* An ordered Sequence
* Unabiguous and well defined
* Perform a task
* Halt in a finite time

**Good algorithms are efficient**

To develop algorithm design, consider the ice cream or WIFI coverage problem:  A town wants to grant access to icecream to all citizens. What is the minimum number of access points needed to give everyone coverage?  The details of this problem (using WiFi instead of icecream) is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1npOrwCrM80LCXMgRYGM6V-gNm-pbpIp9KBUca2P5AMs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Sorting Cards
Students will define their own algorithms for sorting cards using the commands swap, shift, and compare.  They will evaluate the sorting algorithms in the room for efficiency as defined by "the algorithm with the minimum number of moves".

Some sorting algorithms are better in different.  To see a visualization of different sorting algorithms check out [sorting.at](http://sorting.at/).

## Arrays and Sorting
Students will create an algorithm in Java that leverages Arrays to store a list of information.

**Lab:** What is the minimum age someone must be in order to buy a gun?  Write a program that takes a list of ages and outputs a median age. The array you must use is below:

[18, 18, 18, 21, 18, 25, 21, 18, 18, 18, 16, 10000, 99, 18, 25, 10000]

## ArrayList and Scanner
Students will implement a scanner to accept user input in to a program and store that information in an ArrayList.

**Lab:** Create a program that accepts positive numeric input from the user and stores it in an ArrayList.  Your program should stop collecting numbers when the user inputs a negative number. (And should indicate this to the user).

After the list has been completed, sort the numbers and print them to the user in order (min to max).

## Quiz: Input, Arrays, and Sorting
Students will write a single program to solve the problem provided. For this quiz, I ENCOURAGE you to use Dr. Java in another window, and copy and paste your work in to the solution in this window.

## The For Each Loop - April 5th


## Boxcar and FreightTrain - April 6th
Students will return after spring break to a review project which asks them to create two classes and methods that work together.  You will have time to complete this assignment in class Monday and Tuesay however it is not due until Friday.

[Boxcar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7U0nPSLAaqQIPHoVisHRYj0D46y0CYm3xldqOSw9PY/edit?usp=sharing)

[FreightTrain](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6EtSUEjp2DqxwwRVcSMD_gCA-o0JXjlluRSdE9oD_s/edit?usp=sharing)

**Rubric**

**Program (25 pts EACH)** | **Excellent** | **Good** | **Approaching** | **Poor/Incomplete**
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Program Execution | Program executes correctly with no syntax or runtime errors  | | Program executes correctly with minor (easily fixed) errors | Program does not execute
Correct Output | Program displays correct output with no errors and passes all test cases (within Ms. Burton's test class) (25)| Output has minor errors | Output has multiple errors | Output is incorrect
Design of Logic | Program is logically well designed | Program has slight logic errors that do not significantly affect the results | Program has significant logic errors | program is incorrect 
Standards | Program is stylistically well designed | Few inappropriate design choices (ie. porr variable names, improper indentation) | Program includes several inappropriate design chocies  | Program is poorly written 
Documentation | Program is well documented | Missing one required comment | Missing two or more required comments | Most or all documentation missing
